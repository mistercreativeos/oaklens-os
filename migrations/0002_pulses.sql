-- Migration 0002 — the pulse table.
--
-- A pulse is a short, immediate note the owner posts to the homepage: a glyph,
-- a line, a state. It is deliberately NOT on the git publish path that frames
-- and posts travel (console → data/*.json → commit → Workers Build). That road
-- is right for archival content and wrong for something posted several times a
-- day from a phone: it would cost a full redeploy per pulse and burn a fork's
-- free build minutes doing it. A pulse is mutable, personal, short-lived state —
-- which is the D1 tier by the storage rule in CLAUDE.md.
--
-- ONE table serves both jobs. The CURRENT pulse is the newest row whose
-- expires_at is still in the future; the LOG is every row, forever. So an
-- expired pulse needs no cleanup job and no second home — it simply stops
-- matching the current query while staying in the log. Retiring a pulse early
-- (DELETE /api/pulse) moves expires_at to now rather than deleting the row, for
-- the same reason.
--
-- THERE IS NO TITLE COLUMN, and that is the one thing to know before adding one
-- back. The card names itself PULSE on every card and every fork
-- (src/shared/pulse.js PULSE_LABEL). An earlier cut stored a free-text `kicker`
-- that defaulted to the starter pack's discipline, so the same feature
-- introduced itself as PHOTOGRAPHY on one post and TECH / DEV on the next and a
-- reader could not tell what the tile was. Renamed and dropped 2026-08-13; see
-- docs/maintenance/2026-08-13-pulse-rename-and-studio.md.
--
-- Every remaining text field is FREE TEXT on purpose. An earlier design gave the
-- footer named slots for "gear / batch / take number", which is a
-- camera-metadata field wearing a different hat — it would serve photographers
-- and quietly tell writers, musicians, filmmakers and podcasters that this
-- software is not for them. The author types whatever their discipline calls
-- for, or nothing.
